# odin-recipes
A repo for the HTML project on Odin

This is the first real project in the OdinProject. Here we get our first taste of creating the barebones a website using HTML. We are going to create a webite with various links that will link out to different websites containing recipes across the web.

We will use many of the skills already looked at throughout including

- File Management
- Naming Conventions
- Terminal Usage (BASH)
- HTML Boilerplate
- HTML Page Set Up
- HTML Semantics
- HTML Headings, Paragraphs and Text
- HTML Links and Directory Navigation
- Git Cloning, Modifying, Staging and Committing
- Git Logging
